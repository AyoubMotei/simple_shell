<h1>Simple Shell Project</h1>
<p>This repository contains the code for a simple UNIX command line interpreter, also known as a shell. The shell is implemented in several versions, each building upon the previous version and adding new functionality.</p>

<h2>Task 0: Betty would be proud</h2>
<p>Write a beautiful code that passes the Betty checks.</p>

<h2>Task 1: Simple shell 0.1</h2>
<p>Write a basic UNIX command line interpreter.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command.</li>
  <li>The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.</li>
  <li>The command lines are simple, consisting of only one word.</li>
  <li>If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.</li>
  <li>Handle errors and the "end of file" condition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Task 2: Simple shell 0.2</h2>
<p>Enhance the shell to handle command lines with arguments.</p>

<h2>Task 3: Simple shell 0.3</h2>
<p>Further enhance the shell by handling the PATH and not calling fork if the command doesn't exist.</p>

<h2>Task 4: Simple shell 0.4</h2>
<p>Implement the exit built-in command that exits the shell.</p>

<h2>Task 5: Simple shell 1.0</h2>
<p>Implement the env built-in command that prints the current environment.</p>

<h2>Task 6: Simple shell 0.1.1 (Advanced)</h2>
<p>Write your own getline function and optimize the reading process.</p>

<h2>Task 7: Simple shell 0.2.1 (Advanced)</h2>
<p>Implement the shell without using strtok.</p>

<h2>Task 8: Simple shell 0.4.1 (Advanced)</h2>
<p>Handle arguments for the built-in exit command.</p>

<h2>Task 9: setenv, unsetenv (Advanced)</h2>
<p>Implement the setenv and unsetenv built-in commands to manipulate environment variables.</p>

<h2>Task 10: cd (Advanced)</h2>
<p>Implement the cd built-in command to change the current directory.</p>

<h2>Task 11: ; (Advanced)</h2>
<p>Handle the commands separator ";" to execute multiple commands.</p>

<h2>Task 12: && and || (Advanced)</h2>
<p>Handle the shell logical operators "&&" and "||" to execute commands conditionally.</p>

<h2>Task 13: alias (Advanced)</h2>
<p>Implement the alias built-in command to define and print aliases.</p>

<h2>Task 14: Variables (Advanced)</h2>
<p>Handle variables replacement, including the special variables "$?" and "$$".</p>

<h2>Task 15: Comments (Advanced)</h2>
<p>Handle comments in the shell by ignoring lines starting with "#".</p>

<p>Each task builds upon the previous ones, adding new features and functionality to the shell. The goal is to create a fully functional command line interpreter.</p>
